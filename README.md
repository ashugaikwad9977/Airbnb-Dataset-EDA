# Exploratory Data Analysis On Airbnb Data 
In this project on Airbnb dataset 2019 we have used "Python" to perform Data preparation, Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Visualization tasks.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

The primary goal of this project is to utilize data visualization techniques in Python for gaining a deeper understanding of the dataset. Our objective is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and employ various visualization methods to extract meaningful insights from the data. This project seeks to leverage the power of visualization to provide a visual, intuitive comprehension of the dataset.
